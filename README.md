## Description

nuBuilder enables you to make any application that want or need with the least amount of effort and learning.

nuBuilder Forte is in its 4th version of nuBuilder and is a browser-based tool created by ***nuSoftware*** for developing web-based database applications.

nuBuilder uses either ***MySQL*** or ***Maria DB*** databases and gives its users the ability to do database operations like: 
* Search
* Create
* Insert
* Read
* Update
* Delete

### Alternative to MS-Access
nuBuilder provides an ideal replacement/upgrade from **MS-Access**. It won't get slower and slower as you add more records, unlike **MS-Access**.

### Easy To Learn For End Users
nuBuilder uses an Uncluttered Interface which makes it very easy for new users to find there way around.

### Easy To Learn For Developers
nuBuilder is designed to be as easy as possible to get started with building **Forms** and **Search** Screens. With online videos and documentation, you have all the information you need to become a nuBuilder developer.

### Build Business Applications Fast
nuBuilder makes it affordable to build custom business solutions.

### Web Based
nuBuilder is fully web based which means you can use it anywhere and ***end users do not need to install anything***.

### Open Source
nuBuilder is free to download and install on your own web server with zero licence fees.

### Use your existing PHP and MySQL skills
nuBuilder is built upon industry standard technology stack and does not require you to learn any non-standard languages or templating systems.

### Single File Backup
nuBuilder stores all forms, reports, company data and PHP/JavaScript code in MySQL. You can backup your entire application within a single database file.

### Alternative to Oracle Application Express
nuBuilder is a enterprise level application builder but with no limitations on database size or CPU usage.

## Installation

1. Upload the unzipped nuBuilder files to your webroot
2. Create a database (e.g. nubuilder4 )
